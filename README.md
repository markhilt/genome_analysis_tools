# genome_analysis_tools

This repo contains scripts that I frequenctly use in genome assembly analysis.

find_telomeres.py and n50.py are used for diagnosis of assemblies.

 asm_cov_break.py and convert_mol_cov.py are used to parse output from tigmint molecule to break assemblies in regions where 10X barcode coverage drops.
